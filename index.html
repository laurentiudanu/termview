        <p>Before the world was even created, there was an unending war between two entities, much to the chagrin of the vast Primordials; and thus they were locked up together inside a prison: the Mad Moon. As the world of Dota 2 captured the Mad Moon inside it's gravitational fields, all seemed fine, but underneath the crust, the two inhabitants were at work on freeing themselves. After what can only be thought of as a long time, they managed to free themselves and fell together with some of the remains of their prison to the planet. But nothing really is that simple, as some of the entities on the battlefield clearly seem to have had a hand in this. But, however cloudy, the visuals to this backstory can be found here. What fell to the surface would influence the civilizations that settled around these fragments, granting them kinetic energy, mana, protection, even resurrection. However, the entities could not let go off their pasts and soon, they were at war again, this time using not only the civilizations, but even calling forth heroes to fight their little quarrel.</p>
